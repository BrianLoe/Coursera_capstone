# Coursera IBM Applied Data Science Capstone
## Introduction
Space exploration aims to gather and discover scientific knowledge that could expand human understanding about the universe. 
With great interest, many space companies have tried to compete with each other to seek if any other planets are suitable for habitation.
However, the cost for launching rockets are not economical. So, Space X aims to reuse their first stage rocket launch to reduce the cost. This could prove much savings for rocket launches in the future and greatly expand our knowledge about the space.  

In this project, I used CRISP-DM process to make a prediction on a rocket launch first stage landing succession based on historical data of Space X Falcon 9 rocket launches. From business understanding, this project aims to share information to alternate companies that wants to bid against Space X for rocket launch. The information provided is to help determining whether I can predict if the first stage of rocket launch will be successfull and thus can detemine the cost. I start with data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with seaborn library and SQL, visual analytics, and predictive analytics.

## Methodology
1. Data collection (Space X API and webscraping)
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Interactive visual analytics (Dashboard) using dash
5. Predictive analytics (Classification)
